Description: The irregularly-spaced data are interpolated onto regular latitude-longitude grids by weighting each station according to its distance and angle from the center of a search radius. In addition to this, we also provide a simple way (Jones and Hulme, 1996) to grid the irregularly-spaced data points onto regular latitude-longitude grids by averaging all stations in grid-boxes.
